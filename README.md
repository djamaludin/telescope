Telescope
=========

Telescope is a proof-of-concept secure end-to-end encryption surveillance
camera utility. It runs on a Raspberry Pi, but can be used on any device 
that runs Linux. It relies on Motion to capture movement events and 
surveillance. The resulting photos are encrypted using a user generated 
public key (GnuPG backend) and uploaded to a cloud service provider such 
as Dropbox. Encryption of data at rest and data in motion is implemented.

> **WARNING** -
> Telescope is still being developed and should not be considered stable or 
> production ready. Pull or deploy at your own risk.

Requirements and Dependencies
-----------------------------
Telescope was designed for use on a Raspberry Pi, however it can run on any
embedded computer or computer capable or running Linux. The proof-of-concept
system utilised the following hardware and software.

Hardware
   * [Raspberry Pi Model B (512MB)](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)
   * [Power Adapter](http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals#Power_adapters)
   * [SD Card](http://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards)
   * [Compatible Webcam](http://elinux.org/RPi_USB_Webcams)
   * [Powered USB Hub (optional)](http://elinux.org/RPi_Powered_USB_Hubs)
   * [USB WIFI Adaptor (optional)](http://elinux.org/RPi_USB_Wi-Fi_Adapters)

Software
   * [Rasbian](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
   * [Python](http://python.org) 3.2
   * [GnuPG](http://www.gnupg.org/)
   * [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome)
   * [inotify-tools](https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools)
   * [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/)
   * [Dropbox-Uploader](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader)

You can either use your OS package manager such as apt-get or aptitude to
install these packages.

```
sudo apt-get install python3 gnupg motion inotify-tools curl
```

To get Dropbox-Uploader you can visit the repository or use wget.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader/master/dropbox_uploader.sh
```


Server Installation and Setup
-----------------------------
1. Download telescope_server.py, start_motion.bash, start_telescope_server.bash
into chosen Telescope directory.

2. Edit telescope_server.py file with configuration settings. An example of the configuration header is below.
   * Set dir_dec to the directory path of decrypted photos (motion output directory)
   * Set dir_enc to the directory path of encrypted photos
   * Set encryption_key to the GPG public key fingerprint
   * Set the dropbox_upload to the path to dropbox_uploader.sh script

    ```
    dir_dec = "/home/pi/telescope/photos/" # Directory of decrypted photos
    dir_enc = "/home/pi/telescope/photos_enc/" # Directory of encrypted photos
    encryption_key = "012345678" # GPG Public Key Fingerprint
    dropbox_upload = "/home/pi/telescope/dropbox_uploader.sh" # Path to dropbox_uploader.sh
    ```

3. Run dropbox_uploader.sh and follow instructions to configure access to Dropbox.

4. Edit start_motion.bash to add the location of the motion configuration file. An example of this is below.
```
motion -c /home/pi/telescope/configuration/motion_640x480.conf
```

5. Change permissions of Telescope directory to local user (where [user] is your local user).
```
sudo chown -R [user]:[user] /home/[user]/telescope/
```

6. Make telescope_server.py, start_motion.bash, start_telescope_server.bash executable.
```
chmod +x telescope_server.py
chmod +x start_motion.bash
chmod +x start_telescope_server.bash
```

7. As local user, add to crontab using
```
crontab -e
```
the following:
```
@reboot [path to start_telescope_server.bash]
@reboot [path to start_motion.bash]
```

This automatically starts the Telescope server and motion when the Raspberry Pi is booted.

Notes

   * The GPG public key should reside in .gpg in the home directory of the user. 
   * Future versions of Telescope should allow you to configure a custom gpg directory.
   * Also note that the dropbox-uploader.sh script is only required for use on a Raspberry Pi as there is no native 
Dropbox client. On x86 or x86-64 computers, you can use the native client and set the dir_enc setting to a folder in the Dropbox.



Client Installation and Setup
-----------------------------
The client can be any device capable of pulling files from Dropbox.
The proof-of-concept system was a Linux laptop running a native Dropbox 
client.

1. Download telescope_client.py, start_telescope_client.bash 
into chosen Telescope directory.

2. Edit telescope_client.py file with configuration settings. An example of the configuration header is below.
   * Set dir_dec to the path of decrypted photos
   * Set dir_enc to the path of encrypted photos
   * Set encryption_key to the GPG public key fingerprint

    ```
    dir_dec = "/home/pi/telescope/photos/" # Directory of decrypted photos
    dir_enc = "/home/pi/telescope/photos_enc/" # Directory of encrypted photos
    encryption_key = "012345678" # GPG Public Key Fingerprint
    ```

3. Change permissions of Telescope directory to the local user (where [user] is your local user).
```
sudo chown -R [user]:[user] /home/[user]/telescope/
```

4. Make telescope_client.py, start_telescope_client.bash executable
```
chmod +x telescope_client.py
chmod +x start_telescope_client.bash
```

5. Run telescope_client.py to decrypt files from Dropbox. Or if you used a GPG Private Key without a password, you can do the next step to provide auto decryption of photos.

6. (Optional) As local user, add to crontab using:
```
crontab -e
```
the following:
```
@reboot [path to start_telescope_client.bash]
```

This automatically starts the Telescope client when the client is booted and allows for auto decryption of photos.

Future Work
-----------
1. Support use of the Raspberry Pi Foundation Camera Module.
2. Allow custom GnuPG directories to be configured (Not needed if there is automatic key generation and management).
3. Automatic generation of GPG keys.
4. Allow different cloud backup services or servers to be configured.
5. Provide an easier installation mechanism.
6. Heartbeat mechanism.
